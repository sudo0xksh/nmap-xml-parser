# 🧠🔥 Nmap XML Parser 🔥🧠

Nmap XML Parser is a tiny Python CLI tool that converts scary, ugly, soul-crushing Nmap XML
output into clean, readable port scan results 🧹✨

It exists for one simple reason: **reading XML manually is pain** 😵‍💫  
This tool removes the noise and shows only what actually matters —
open ports 🔓, their state 🟢🔴, and the services running on them 🛠️

## 👀 Overview

Nmap can export scan results in XML format for automation and reporting 🤖📄  
Machines love XML.  
Humans? **Absolutely not** ❌😂

This tool parses the XML output generated by Nmap and prints a clean summary directly
to the terminal so you don’t have to scroll, zoom, cry, and regret your life choices.

## 🚀 Features (Small Tool, Big Relief)

- Parses Nmap XML scan files 📂
- Extracts port number, port state, and service name 🔍
- Displays clean, readable output 🧠
- Lightweight and fast ⚡
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand 😌

## ⚙️ How It Works (No Rocket Science)

The script reads the XML file generated by Nmap, walks through all `<port>` elements,
extracts important attributes like port ID, state, and service name,
and prints them in a simple human-readable format 🧾➡️👀

Fast analysis.  
No unnecessary complexity.  
No XML-induced headache.

## 🧪 Usage (Very Complicated, Please Focus 😈)

First, run an Nmap scan and save the output in XML format:

```bash
nmap -oX scan.xml target.com

#Then, parse the XML output using this tool:
python nmap_xmlparser.py scan.xml
